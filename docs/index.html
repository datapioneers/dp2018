  Welcome to the first edition of the Data Pioneers conference!
</p>
<p>
  Extracting knowledge from data and using it to build data products as well as
  optimize industrial processes and business becomes more and more present and
  is inevitable to ensure competitiveness. The Data Pioneers 2018 conference
  provides a regional platform for data scientists to exchange experiences on how
  to successfully use data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence
  in industry and business. The conference offers a day of inspiring talks and the
  possibility to network with like-minded data scientists, data engineers and
  team leaders.
</p>
<p>
  Data Pioneers is created because we truly believe that the Allgäu and the Vierländerregion
  Bodensee with the region around the Lake of Constance, Vorarlberg,
  St. Galler Rheintal, and Liechtenstein
  is an exciting area with established enterprises as well as aspiring startups
  working in a data-driven way or on data products. Our motivation
  is to create a stimulating event with real-world applications of predictive
  analytics, examples of crunching data on an industrial scale, and exchange
  on establishing a data-driven culture. Exciting talks should spark the imagination,
  the open culture should lead to discussions, and the mindset of the conference
  should make data pioneers ready to drive future innovations.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Talks:</b> Data Pioneers 2018 provides high-profile talks from experienced
  regional data scientists. The topics cover data science, machine learning,
  and artificial intelligence in industrial and business relevant
  settings and applications. The final list of speakers is available in
  the speakers section.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Program:</b> The conference is held on November 8th 2018, 9-17h. The program
  includes exciting key note presentations, in-depth data science talks, and
  lunch and coffee breaks for networking and inspiring exchanges on how to
  extract knowledge from data. The conference language is English.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Registration:</b> The regular conference ticket is 75€, the student ticket
  is 25€. The ticket includes entrance to the conference,
  lunch and coffee breaks. Registration was closed on November 5.

        <span>Boosting Assembly Lines with Machine Learning</span>
      </h3>

      <p class="speakers-bio">A key challenge in running production lines efficiently is to detect bad parts early in the manufacturing process. Machine learning allows to predict the status of parts, but as bad ones are rare and misclassifying good ones is expensive, finding feasible models is hard. We present how we train and select profitable models to detect bad parts in our assembly processes and show the challenges we faced when dealing with imbalanced datasets from manufacturing lines.</p>

        <span>Application of Supervised Learning to Predict the Quality of a Welding Process</span>
      </h3>

      <p class="speakers-bio">In industry end-of-life tests are necessary to verify that products operate reliably. Since it is not possible to test devices at real stress conditions, accelerated stress tests in combination with statistical models are commonly applied. In this study, data from a welding process, welding spatter data and lifetime data, are investigated. For the classification of welding spatters, decision trees, kNN, k-means and linear regression models are evaluated. For the prediction of product lifetime, linear regression models are analyzed and compared with neural network models. </p>

        <span>Price Optimization: Applied Machine-Learning to drive business decisions</span>
      </h3>

      <p class="speakers-bio">The talk guides through the challenges of applying decision-making algorithms based on machine learning to business processes by means of Price Optimization. In the context of Price Optimization accurate demand forecasts enable retailer to find prices according to their business strategy, consumer demand and market conditions. Forecasts for demand and price elasticities are regression tasks that can be addressed by supervised learning algorithms. On the one hand, rare events such as holidays, weather effects, promotions and trends evolving over time require special treatment. On the other hand, the particular use of the forecasts to actively steer prices imposes the substantial challenge to identify the casual effect of price changes to customers’ demand. That is why Data-Scientists involved in Price Optimization face problems that cover exciting parts across areas from statistical learning, discrete optimization, reinforcement learning and many more. A detailed view on these statistical challenges, many practical aspects and insights of the potential of these applications are provided within this talk.</p>

Katharina Brunner will speak about some projects she has been working on at the Süddeutsche Zeitung, one of the largest and most important newspaper in the South of Germany. For example: How to get an idea of the blackbox Facebook? How has the German Parliament changed ever since the AfD entered the scene? And, most important, how to communicate the findings in a non-nerdy way?</p>

        <span>Turning Measurements into Optimal Control Signals</span>
      </h3>

      <p class="speakers-bio">The heart of sonnen’s products, such as the sonnenBatterie and the sonnenCharger, is to allow their users to optimize the consumption of their self-generated energy. In addition, these devices are also very well suited to offer flexibility to the energy market as they allow a quick and precise reaction to fluctuations of decentralized renewable energy sources. The sonnenBatterie and the sonnenCharger hence come with a charge control that ensures an optimal mix of savings by self-consumed energy and additional revenues from different flexibility markets and grid services. In this talk, I will show how predictions built from historic measurement data are turned into optimal control signals by means of Mathematical Programming.</p>
